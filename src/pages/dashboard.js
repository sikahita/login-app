        <h3>Hi</h3>
            <p>
              Right now I'm busy working at a Payment Gateway company in Jakarta while studying at Binus Online Learning majoring in S1 Information Systems. 
              It's been almost 4 years I migrated to Jakarta, whoaa time flies! And I'm studying already in 6th semesters, yay! According to the schedule, 
              I will graduate in the middle of 2023. I hope I can graduate on time~ Aamiin
